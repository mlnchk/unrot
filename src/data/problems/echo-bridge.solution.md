The solution lies in analyzing the music box's rhythm structure. The "skipped beats" aren't mistakes - they're deliberate rests that form a pattern corresponding to prime number intervals.

When you ring the bells with pauses that match these prime intervals (2, 3, 5, 7 beats of silence between rings), the echoes interact constructively with each other, creating a harmonic resonance that the bridge recognizes.

The specific sequence is: Ring bell 1, wait 2 beats, ring bell 3, wait 3 beats, ring bell 6, wait 5 beats, ring bell 7. The resulting echo pattern forms a standing wave that neutralizes the barrier. The actual notes don't matter - only the temporal spacing between them.
