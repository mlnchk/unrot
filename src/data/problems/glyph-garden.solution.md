The glyphs represent constellations, and their correct orientation corresponds to their position in the night sky during the spring equinox at the garden's latitude.

The "geometric patterns" that appear between pedestals are actually partial star maps. When all glyphs are properly aligned, these patterns combine to form a complete celestial chart.

The cryptic message about the serpent and phoenix refers to two specific constellations: Serpens (which must NOT form a complete loop in the pattern) and Phoenix (which must be visible in the southern section). The correct configuration creates a star map showing the night sky as it appeared on the garden's construction date, unlocking the chamber through an astronomical mechanism.
