#### Step 1. Identifying the most important statement to take up first for analysis:

Follow the fundamental rule in analyzing a collection of statements:

> The most important statement in the conversation must be the **one with maximum information**.

Among all, the **key statement** stands out:

> If you multiply their ages, you would get 36; but if you add them up, you’d get the number of passengers in this tramcar.

#### Step 2. Role Playing:

- Imagine yourself as the first friend trying to decode this puzzle. Focus on the key statement. This will make your thinking easier.

> The first friend must have listed out in his mind, each combination of the three age values with product 36. And then checked the sum with the number of passengers in the tramcar. So you should also follow in his footsteps.
>
> **You don't know the number of passengers**, but you can **at least take the first step.**

#### Step 3. Exhaustive Enumeration of three numbers with product 36: Must not miss any combination

- Start by **finding all combinations of factors of 36 and their sums**_systematically_ (the friend must have done this, so you must as well). **Take up the basis as the prime factors of 36 including 1:**
  - \*\*36 =\*\***1x2x2x3x3** ⇨ The **prime factors** (that cannot further be broken up as a product of factors) of 36 **are 1, 2, 2, 3 and 3**.

- **Systematic method to ensure you get all combinations of factors of 36 each with three values representing ages of the three children:** Start with 1 as the first factor, then 2 as the first factor, ending with 3 as the first factor.
  - 1 + 1 + 36 = 38 (Not possible because of the 20-year gap)
  - 1 + 2 + 18 = 21
  - 1 + 3 + 12 = 16
  - 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
  - 1 + 6 + 6 = 13

These are all combinations with **1 as the first factor.**

- Move on to **2 and then 3 as the first factor:**
  - 2 + 2 + 9 = 13
  - 2 + 3 + 6 = 11
  - 3 + 3 + 4 = 10

These are the feasible combinations **with 1, 2 and 3 as the first factor:**

| Ages (years) | Sum | Notes              |
| ------------ | --- | ------------------ |
| 1, 2, 18     | 21  |                    |
| 1, 3, 12     | 16  |                    |
| 1, 4, 9      | 14  |                    |
| 1, 6, 6      | 13  | Same sum pair (13) |
| 2, 2, 9      | 13  | Same sum pair (13) |
| 2, 3, 6      | 11  |                    |
| 3, 3, 4      | 10  |                    |

#### Step 4. Identify the reason behind the lingering doubt in the first friend's mind:

The **most important question:**

> Why couldn't the first friend determine the kids' ages even after knowing the product and sum, when the sum was equal to the number of passenger known to him?
>
> **Answer:** There must have been **a deadlock** in the seven combinations **with two of the combinations having the same sum**. That must be the reason the first friend needed further information to clear up his doubt.

Identify these two:

> 1 + 6 + 6 = 13 and 2 + 2 + 9 = 13.

#### Step 5. How could the first friend break the deadlock?

The **most important question now:**

> Which answer from the second friend could break the deadlock?
>
> **Answer:** Identify **any specific pattern in the two combinations** that stands out. This depends on your ability to spot key patterns, an essential ability in problem solving.

Both the combinations have **two ages same** and **sum also same**—this pattern only helped isolate these two combinations as potential candidates for the ultimate solution. You already know it. **What else is a new pattern in these two?**

Spot the only other pattern in the two combinations that stands out:

- 1, 6, 6 has the **two same ages at the end.**
- 2, 2, 9 has the **two same ages in the beginning.**

**Hidden clues** of this new pattern:

- The combination **1, 6, 6 has two older children of the same age**, but the combination **2, 2, 9 has only one oldest child.**
- Same way, the combination **1, 6, 6 has one youngest child**.

#### Step 6: Deadlock broken—Hidden Clue Discovered

The only term referring to ages of the children was **"oldest"** in the second friend's subsequent statement: **"My oldest kid is a great sports person." matches the first hidden clue.**

> He **referred to only one oldest kid**, not two. Out of the two combinations 1, 6, 6 and 2, 2, 9, the second combination must be the answer.

**Answer:** The _ages of the three children are 2, 2 and 9 years._

### Sum up

- **First,** you have learned the basic rule in identifying the most important statement to focus on.
- **Second,** you tried to think in the way the first friend thought.
- **Third,** in doing so, you did what you could—devised a foolproof method and listed out all feasible combinations of ages of the three children having a product of 36.
- **Fourth,** you could identify the reason behind the lingering doubt in the first friend's mind. You knew at that point, the doubt must have been cleared up by a subsequent statement from the second friend.
- **Fifth,** in your attempt to find how the first friend could clear up his doubt, you discovered the hidden clue to the puzzle.
- **Sixth,** you found the answer itself.

This step-by-step technique of forming a doubt, finding the answer, analyzing it, and then forming the next doubt, proceeding in a series of question, answer and analysis is powerful.

To get assured solution with this method, **at every stage, you must form the most important question in your mind**, gradually narrowing down the possibilities. Our name for this never-failing problem solving technique is the **QAA technique of inventive problem solving.**
