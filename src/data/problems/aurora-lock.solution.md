The key is recognizing that each color represents a specific wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum. The "invisible thread" refers to the progression from longer wavelengths (red) to shorter ones (violet).

By tracking only the lights at maximum intensity across the grid, you'll notice they form a path that corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence when mapped to their grid positions.

The correct input sequence is: Red (3), Orange (5), Yellow (8), Green (13) - representing the Fibonacci numbers modulo 16 to fit within the visible spectrum range. This pattern "resonates" with natural harmonic frequencies.
