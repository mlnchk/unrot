### The 17 Minute Bridge Crossing Riddle

Four persons to cross a frail bridge at night with only one torch between them. They cross the bridge at different speeds, individually taking 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.

The bridge being weak, at most two can walk on the bridge while crossing together. They must all cross over to the other side within 17 minutes. Otherwise, they will be in great danger.

How could they cross the bridge safely?

**Hint:** Strategic thinking, identifying and overcoming bottlenecks needed.
