An ancient garden contains twelve stone pedestals, each carved with a unique glyph that can be rotated to one of four cardinal orientations. The garden's center holds a sealed chamber that archaeologists believe contains historical texts.

Each glyph appears to be a combination of geometric shapes - circles, triangles, and lines - but their meaning has been lost to time. Previous explorers noted that rotating any single glyph causes faint geometric patterns to appear briefly in the air between adjacent pedestals.

A weathered tablet at the entrance reads: "When earth and sky align in twelve positions, the words of ancients shall emerge from stone. Let not the serpent bite its tail before the phoenix rises."
