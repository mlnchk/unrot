A mysterious vault door displays an ever-changing pattern of colored lights arranged in a 5x5 grid. The lights pulse in waves that resemble the aurora borealis, shifting through various colors and intensities.

Local legend suggests that the vault was designed by a physicist who was obsessed with electromagnetic waves and natural phenomena. The door will only open when someone replicates the correct sequence on a small control panel.

You have three attempts before the system locks down for 24 hours. The only clue is an inscription: "Follow the invisible thread from red to violet, but count only what resonates."
