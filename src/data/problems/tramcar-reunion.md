Two friends met in a tramcar after years. Their talks went like this,

— How are you?

— Thank you, I am fine.

— You just got married when we met last about 20 years back. It has been a long time. Any children?

— I have three kids!

— Wow! How old are they?

— Well, if you multiply their ages, you would get 36; but if you add them up, you’d get the number of passengers in this tramcar.

— Got you, but you didn't tell me enough to figure out their ages.

— My oldest kid is a great sports person.

— Aha! Now I know their ages.

Figure out the ages of the three kids.

> **Hint:** Focus on the most important statement. Think exhaustively.
