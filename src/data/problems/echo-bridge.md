A narrow stone bridge spans a deep canyon. At each end stands a bell tower, and the bridge itself has seven suspended bells along its length. Legend says the bridge will only allow passage when the bells are rung in the correct sequence.

Ringing any bell causes it to echo off the canyon walls, creating a complex pattern of sounds. Local musicians have tried countless melodies, but none have succeeded. The bridge remains impassable, with an invisible barrier blocking anyone who rings the wrong pattern.

An old music box found nearby plays a simple tune, but it seems to skip beats in odd places. Carved into its base: "Time is not the notes you play, but the spaces in between."
