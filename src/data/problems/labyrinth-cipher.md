An eccentric architect has hidden a treasure deep within a modular labyrinth. Each chamber in the maze is labeled with a fragment of a quotation. The fragments shift position every minute following a predictable but puzzling cadence.

To unlock the vault, you must determine the original quotation, the author, and the order in which the chambers must be visited. Every wrong attempt causes the maze to reconfigure, making brute force attempts futile.

Fortunately, the architect left behind a cryptic field journal with notes on symmetry, prime intervals, and a curious reference to "listening for silent letters."
