## The burning ropes timer riddle

Measure a time of 45 minutes by burning two ropes each of which takes 1 hour to burn out.

The ropes are of same length but none of the two burns at a uniform rate throughout the length. That's why you cannot just measure a point at three-fourth of the length of a rope and start burning at that point to measure 45 minutes.

Only saving grace is the allowance that one or both of the ropes can be burned simultaneously at multiple points.
